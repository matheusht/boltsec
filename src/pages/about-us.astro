        OUR STORY
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-5xl font-bold text-white mb-8 text-weight-semibold text-center">We're Not Your Typical Consultants. We're <span class="text-[#0579c0]">Builders.</span></h2>
      <p class="text-2xl text-white mb-6">
        We started Boltsec because we were tired of seeing fast-moving startups get burned by slow, overly complex, or simply ineffective security solutions. We saw founders and CTOs drowning in compliance demands, facing budget constraints, and getting frustrated with generic vulnerability reports that offered little actionable insight.
      </p>
      <p class="text-2xl text-white mb-6">
        Traditional penetration testing felt like a black box – expensive, time-consuming, and often delivered reports that felt more like a "PDF landfill" than a roadmap to security. On the other hand, relying solely on automated scanners felt like gambling with our future.
      </p>
       <p class="text-2xl text-white mb-6">
       We knew there had to be a better way – a way to deliver enterprise-grade security insights without the enterprise price tag or bureaucracy. A way to blend the indispensable creativity and context of expert human hackers with the speed and efficiency of cutting-edge AI.
      </p>
       <p class="text-2xl text-white mb-6">
        That's why we built Boltsec. We're a team of experienced founders and security practitioners who've been in your shoes. We understand the pressure to move fast while staying secure, to pass audits without draining your coffers, and to get clear, actionable results you can implement today.
      </p>
       <p class="text-2xl text-white">
        Our mission is to give you the security confidence you need to build and scale without fear. We provide pragmatic, no-nonsense security solutions built specifically for the startup reality.
